/**
 * A hotel manager has to process N advance bookings of rooms for the next
 * season. His hotel has K rooms. Bookings contain an arrival date and a
 * departure date. He wants to find out whether there are enough rooms in the
 * hotel to satisfy the demand. Write a program that solves this problem in time
 * O(N log N) .
 * 
 * Input:
 * 
 * 
 * First list for arrival time of booking. Second list for departure time of
 * booking. Third is K which denotes count of rooms.
 * 
 * Output:
 * 
 * A boolean which tells whether its possible to make a booking. Return 0/1 for
 * C programs. O -> No there are not enough rooms for N booking. 1 -> Yes there
 * are enough rooms for N booking.
 * 
 * Example :
 * 
 * Input : Arrivals : [1 3 5] Departures : [2 6 8] K : 1
 * 
 * Return : False / 0
 * 
 * At day = 5, there are 2 guests in the hotel. But I have only one room.
